    "# Industrial Bioreactor Batch Analysis\n",
    "### Programming for Data Analytics - Final Project\n",
    "**By Stephen Kerr**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates proficiency in data analysis techniques as part of the HDip in Data Analytics program.  I've chosen to work with industrial bioreactor data — a domain directly relevant to my professional interests and the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Life Sciences industry, batch analytics and process understanding are not merely commercial advantages—they are **regulatory requirements**. Before any drug product reaches patients, regulatory bodies (FDA, EMA) demand rigorous process characterization and evidence of consistent manufacturing control. This project mirrors real-world challenges faced by bioprocess engineers daily.\n",

    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** Goldrick et al. (2015), *Journal of Biotechnology* 193:70-82  \n",
    "**Process:** Industrial-scale penicillin production via fed-batch fermentation  \n",
    "**Scale:** 100,000L bioreactor (significantly larger than typical research-scale equipment)  \n",
    "**Organism:** *Penicillium chrysogenum* (industrial strain)  \n",
    "**Data:** 10 production batches where subseted from a larger data source (due to Githubs compute limitations)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Goal\n",
    "Identify critical factors that distinguish high-yielding batches from problematic ones, providing actionable insights for process optimization and control strategy improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Research Questions\n",
    "1. **What characteristics define successful batches?**  \n",
    "   Compare process variable profiles and identify distinguishing features\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Which parameters require tightest control?**  \n",
    "   Determine acceptable operating ranges and critical control points\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Can we predict batch success early?**  \n",
    "   Develop early warning indicators and establish alert thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How should feeding strategies be optimized?**  \n",
    "   Analyze substrate profiles and recommend optimal feeding approaches\n",
    "\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis follows a systematic approach to extract meaningful insights from industrial process data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Acquisition & Understanding**\n",
    "- Load and explore 10 batch records\n",
    "- Create comprehensive data dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**\n",
    "- Handle missing values in offline measurements\n",
    "- Validate data ranges using domain knowledge\n",
    "- Merge batch metadata and categorize by performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "- Calculate derived metrics (OUR, CER, estimated biomass)\n",
    "- Create process phase indicators\n",
    "- Generate control quality metrics\n",
    "- Flag critical events (oxygen depletion, nutrient limitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "- Univariate analysis of key variables\n",
    "- Bivariate relationships (correlations, scatter plots)\n",
    "- Multivariate analysis (correlation matrix, PCA)\n",
    "- Batch comparison and statistical testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Deep Dive Analysis**\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** *High-yielding batches share identifiable common characteristics*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "- Define success metrics (final penicillin yield)\n",
    "- Compare successful vs. unsuccessful batch profiles\n",
    "- Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA) and clustering\n",
    "- Identify distinguishing features and early indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Process Optimization Insights**\n",
    "- Critical control parameters and acceptable ranges\n",
