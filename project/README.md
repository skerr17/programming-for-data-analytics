# PFDA - Assignment Project 

In order to get my data soruce to a small enough size to be able to be processed in Github Codespaces, I decided to use Kaggle's own Code Environment to Subset the data. Please see my work [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stephenkerr17/bioreactor-dataset-preprocessing). The output of this Preprocessing is the dataset that was used for this analysis. 

The Data was originally sourced from Kaggle posted by Stephen Goldrick a professor in University College London (see the orginal source link to kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephengoldie/big-databiopharmaceutical-manufacturing)). The data was generated by an advanced mathmatical simulation of a 100,000 litre penicillin fementation system refeenced as IndPenSim. See the Simulators's site linked [here](http://www.industrialpenicillinsimulation.com/) for more details on the simulator and its details. The development of the simulator was discussed in a research paper titled "The development of an industrial-scale fed-batch fermentation simulation" that can be accessed using this link [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168165614009377). The purpose of their research was to develop a realistic simulation using first principles of an industrial fermentation to be used as a benchmark in process control and optimisation studies.
